              "1   traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip . especially if you have to prepare a presentation . i would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings . i would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary . as far as the business meetings , i think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not . too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn . the meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format . my suggestion for where to go is austin . play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski s . flying somewhere takes too much time

              "12  forwarded by phillip k allen hou ect on pm richard burchfield am to phillip k allen hou ect ect cc beth perlman hou ect ect subject consolidated positions issues to do list phillip , below is the issues to do list as we go forward with documenting the requirements for consolidated physical financial positions and transport trade capture . what we need to focus on is the first bullet in allan s list the need for a single set of requirements . although the meeting with keith , on wednesday , was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen , will be extremely difficult and time consuming . throughout the meeting on wednesday , keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position , so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking much like excel . what needs to happen on monday from is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen , this is critical . this does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future , but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements . also , to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical financial positions and transport trade capture . the other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves , and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project . i have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good . i believe there has been good communication between the teams , but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve . richard forwarded by

consolidated positions issues to do list from our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated positions , i think we still have the following issues we don t have a single point of contact from the trading group . we ve had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders . we really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements . we re getting hit with a lot of different requests , many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation . things left to do i think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what we re trying to accomplish with this project . it ll help determine which requests fall under the project scope . go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope . for those in scope , work to define relative importance priority of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each . define the desired lay out of the position manager screen main view and all drill downs . use the above to formulate a project plan . things requested thus far no particular order inclusion of sitara physical deals into the tds position manager and deal ticker . customized rows and columns in the position manager ad hoc rows columns that add up existing position manager rows columns . new drill down in the position manager to break out positions by physical , transport , swaps , options , ... addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real time values of all curves on which the desk has a position . ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions . each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid . ability to properly show curve shift for float for float deals determine the appropriate positions to show for each gas daily for monthly index , physical gas for nymex , physical gas for inside ferc , physical gas for mid market . ability for tds to pull valuation results based on a tds flag instead of using official valuations . position and p l aggregation across all gas desks . ability to include the gas price book into tds inclusion of spread options in our systems . ability to handle volatility skew and correlations . ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day . approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma

              "13  forwarded by phillip k allen hou ect on pm richard burchfield am to phillip k allen hou ect ect cc beth perlman hou ect ect subject consolidated positions issues to do list phillip , below is the issues to do list as we go forward with documenting the requirements for consolidated physical financial positions and transport trade capture . what we need to focus on is the first bullet in allan s list the need for a single set of requirements . although the meeting with keith , on wednesday , was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen , will be extremely difficult and time consuming . throughout the meeting on wednesday , keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position , so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking much like excel . what needs to happen on monday from is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen , this is critical . this does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future , but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements . also , to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical financial positions and transport trade capture . the other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves , and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project . i have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good . i believe there has been good communication between the teams , but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve . richard forwarded by richard burchfield hou ect on am allan severude pm to richard burchfield hou ect ect cc peggy alix hou ect ect , russ severson hou ect ect , scott mills hou ect ect , kenny ha hou ect ect subject consolidated positions issues to do list from our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated positions , i think we still have the following issues we don t have a single point of contact from the trading group . we ve had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders . we really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements . we re getting hit with a lot of different requests , many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation . things left to do i think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what we re trying to accomplish with this project . it ll help determine which requests fall under the project scope . go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope . for those in scope , work to define relative importance priority of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each . define the desired lay out of the position manager screen main view and all drill downs . use the above to formulate a project plan . things requested thus far no particular order inclusion of sitara physical deals into the tds position manager and deal ticker . customized rows and columns in the position manager ad hoc rows columns that add up existing position manager rows columns . new drill down in the position manager to break out positions by physical , transport , swaps , options , ... addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real time values of all curves on which the desk has a position . ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions . each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid . ability to properly show curve shift for float for float deals determine the appropriate positions to show for each gas daily for monthly index , physical gas for nymex , physical gas for inside ferc , physical gas for mid market . ability for tds to pull valuation results based on a tds flag instead of using official valuations . position and p l aggregation across all gas desks . ability to include the gas price book into tds inclusion of spread options in our systems . ability to handle volatility skew and correlations . ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day . approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a gamma grid . valuation of gas daily options . a new position screen for options months x strike x delta . tbd . inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets . ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position manager . ability to view change deal p l in the tds deal ticker . show new deal terms , prior deal terms , and net p l

going to be significantly higher , roughly . per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a month lease and . . psf if leased on a month term , but by individual room . this property will have the best location for student housing of all new projects , just as the duplexes do now . if this project is of serious interest to you , please let me know as there is a very , very short window of

              "23  forwarded by phillip k allen hou ect on pm from phillip k allen am liane , as we discussed yesterday , i am concerned there may have been an attempt to manipulate the el paso san juan monthly index . it appears that a single buyer entered the marketplace on both september and and paid above market prices . . for san juan gas . at the time of these trades , offers for physical gas at significantly to cents lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation . additionally , these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for san juan . we have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from september to september . these are the complete list of trades from enron online eol , enron s direct phone conversations , and three brokerage firms amerex , apb , and prebon . please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary . we have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of san juan based on several spread relationships . the two key points from this data are as follows . the high physical prices on the th th . , , are much greater than the high financial trades . , . on those days . . the spread relationship between san juan and other points socal northwest is consistent between the end of september and october gas daily . it doesn t make sense to have monthly indices that are dramatically different . i understand you review the trades submitted for outliers . hopefully , the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the . s and these trades are outliers . i wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index . it is enron s belief that the trades at . and higher were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index . it is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to conduct our physical and financial business . please contact me anytime i can assist you towards this goal . sincerely , phillip allen

              "24  liane , as we discussed yesterday , i am concerned there has been an attempt to manipulate the el paso san juan monthly index . a single buyer entered the marketplace on both september and and paid above market prices . . for san juan gas with the intent to distort the index . at the time of these trades , offers for physical gas at significantly to cents lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation . additionally , these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for san juan . we have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from september to september . these are the complete list of trades from enron online eol , enron s direct phone conversations , and three brokerage firms amerex , apb , and prebon . please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary . we have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of san juan based on several spread relationships . the two key points from this data are as follows . the high physical prices on the th th . , , are much greater than the high financial trades . , . on those days . . the spread relationship between san juan and other points socal northwest is consistent between the end of september and october gas daily . it doesn t make sense to have monthly indeces that are dramatically different . i understand you review the trades submitted for outliers . hopefully , the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the . s and these trades are outliers . i wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index . it is enron s belief that the trades at . and higher were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index . it is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to conduct our physical and financial business . please contact me anytime i can assist you towards this goal . sincerely , phillip allen

, ? is the closing today ?? after reviewing the agreement ? i find it isn t binding as far as i can determine .? it is too vague and it doesn t sound like anything an attorney or title company would ? draft for a real estate closing but , of course , i could be wrong .? ? if this ? closing is going to take place without this agreement then there is no point in me following up on this ? document s validity .? ? i will just need to go back to my closing documents and see what s there and find out where i am with that and deal with this as best i can . ? i guess i was expecting something that would be an exhibit to a recordable document or something a little more exact , or rather ? sort of a contract .? this isn t either .? i tried to get a real estate atty on the phone last night but he was out of pocket .? i talked to a crim . atty friend and he said this is out of his area but doesn t sound binding to him .? ? i will go back to mine and phillip allen s transaction ? and take a look at that but as vague and general as this is i doubt that my signature ? is even needed to complete this transaction .? i am in after noon if there is any need to contact me regarding the closing . ? i really do not want to hold up anything or generate more work for myself and i don t want to insult or annoy anyone but this paper really doesn t seem to be something required for a closing .? in the event you do need my signature on something like this i would rather have time to have it reviewed before i accept it . ? brenda ? ?

              "40  george , below is a list of questions that keith and i had regarding the westgate project ownership structure what will be the ownership structure ? limited partnership ? general partner ? what are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what capacity regarding ownership and liabilities ? who owns the land ? improvements ? who holds the various loans ? is the land collateral ? investment what happens to initial investment ? is it used to purchase land for cash ? secure future loans ? why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement ? when is the , actually needed ? now or for the land closing ? investment schedule ? investment return is equity repayment the return of the original investment ? is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits are distributed ? debt which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral is associated with each loan ? improvement construction are these the only two loans ? looks like it from the cash flow statement . terms of each loan ? uses of funds how will disbursements be made ? by whom ? what type of bank account ? controls on max disbursement ? internet viewing for investors ? reports to track expenses vs plan ? bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses ? what is the relationship of creekside builders to the project ? do you get paid a markup on subcontractors as a general contractor and paid gain out of profits ? do you or larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses before the ultimate payout of profits ? design and construction when will design be complete ? what input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units ? what level of investor involvement will be possible during construction planning and permitting ? does creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors , vendors , and other professionals ? such as always getting bids , payment schedules , or reference checking ? are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to use ? names ? these questions are probably very basic to you , but as a first time investor in a project like this it is new to me . also , i want to learn as much as possible from the process . phillip

lewter retwell mail . sanmarcos . net subject westgate proforma phillip allen . xls enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the westgate property is austin that we told you about . as you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over per year over years . this is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market . this is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the austin market . the project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan . as it is in the smart growth corridor area designated by the city of austin for preferred development , this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than months . additionally , many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived . i have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a lot development we investigated in north austin , which included a detention retention and filtration pond and street widening . even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention retention and filtration pond requirement , i used this data to be cautious . the lone star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly . other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline , such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at st . edwards university . as with most infill projects , the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven . we have included a fence around the entire property , but may only put it on westgate and cameron loop . gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences . the seller accepted our offer thursday evening with a price of , and an extended escrow . this will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract , which will mean that we can close into an a d loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan . this analysis shows your investment at , for a interest in the profits of the project . as we discussed in san marcos , we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots , sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot . i believe this would facilitate the use of a exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project . you would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first . larry lewter knows an expert in the field in san antonio if you do not know anyone . i will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker , by airborne express today for saturday delivery . once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma , we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area . please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time . you can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either or . my cell phone is and the fax is . i look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this project that is sure to be a major winner . i regret that it took so long to get back to you , but we had some unusual events these past few weeks . a small freakish wind storm with severe mpg downdrafts hit the south part of austin where we are building town homes . one of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day . the severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down . the city shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract . then last week i had to take my wife to emergency . she has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week .. there is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize the enormous number of things she does everyday . fortunately , it looks as if she will be ok in the long run . george w . richards creekside builders , llc westgate proforma phillip allen . xls
